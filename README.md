This gem helps you maintain a directory sturucture for your mediafiles. For example, if you specify the following about a set of video files:  
* Series title: Game of Thrones
* Season: 5
* Season airdate: 2015  

This program tells you that they should be located in a folder called `Game of Thrones/Season 5 (2015)/`. Of course you can customize this to match whatever file structure you prefer.

If you specify some more data:
* Episode title: What a great episode
* Episode number: 3

The program will also tell you that the episode should be called `game.of.thrones.S05E03.what.a.great.episode.mkv`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem where_to, git: 'https://github.com/jutonz/where_to'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

```ruby
require 'where_to'

# Specify data one at a time
locator = WhereTo::Locator.new 
locator.series_title = 'Game of Thrones'
locator.season = 5
locator.season_airdate = 2015
locator.locate # WhereTo::Location object with 'Game of Thrones/Season 5 (2015)/'

# Specify data in a batch
data = {}
data[:series_title] = 'Game of Thrones'
data[:season] = 5
data[:season_airdate] = 2015
locator = WhereTo::Locator.new data
locator.locate

# Specify episode info
data = {}
data[:series_title] = 'Game of Thrones'
data[:season] = 5
data[:season_airdate] = 2015
data[:episode_title] = 'best episode ever'a
data[:episode_number] = 3
locator = WhereTo::Locator.new data
location = locator.locate
location.folder # => Game of Thrones/Season 5 (2015)
location.filename # => game.of.thrones.s05E02.best.episode.ever.mkv

# You can specify custom file extensions
locator.episode_extension = '.mp4'
locator.locate.filename # => game.of.thrones.s05E02.best.episode.ever.mp4

# And if you like you can specify a video quality
locator.episode_quality = '720p'
locator.locate.filename # => game.of.thrones.s05E02.best.episode.ever.720p.mkv
```

## Custom Formats
Specify custom formats by modifying `format.yml`.  
The default is `"%series_title/Season %season_number (%season_airdate)/"`, but in theory any combination works.
